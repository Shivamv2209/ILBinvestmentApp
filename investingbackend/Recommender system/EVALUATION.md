# Stock Recommender System Evaluation

## Overview

This document evaluates the performance of our content-based stock recommender system, which was trained using stock feature data and user portfolio information.

## Analysis Methodology

We analyzed several user portfolios to evaluate the recommender system's performance:
- User 1: A diversified portfolio with emphasis on Healthcare
- User 100: A technology-focused portfolio
- User 500: A strongly technology-oriented portfolio
- User 1000: A mixed portfolio with Financial Services, Technology, and Communication Services

## Key Findings

### Sector Alignment

The recommender system shows strong consistency in recommending stocks in sectors that align with the user's current portfolio:

1. For User 100 (primarily Technology at 0.56%):
   - 80% of recommendations were in Technology
   - 20% in Healthcare 
   - Recommendations aligned with the user's top portfolio sector

2. For User 500 (primarily Technology at 0.66%):
   - 80% of recommendations were in Technology
   - 20% in Healthcare
   - Recommendations aligned with the user's top portfolio sector

3. For User 1000 (primarily Financial Services):
   - 100% of recommendations were in Technology
   - This suggests a potential bias toward Technology stocks or strong feature similarity

4. For User 1 (primarily Healthcare at 0.33%):
   - 60% of recommendations were in Technology
   - 40% in Healthcare
   - Recommendations suggested diversification from the user's top sector

### Similarity Scores

Across all tested users, the similarity scores for recommendations were consistently high:
- Most top recommendations had similarity scores between 0.7 and 0.85
- This indicates strong content-based matching between user profiles and recommended stocks

## Strengths

1. **Sector Consistency**: The system generally recommends stocks in sectors that are already prominent in a user's portfolio, which is expected for a content-based recommender.

2. **High Similarity Scores**: The recommendations show high similarity to the user's current portfolio profile, indicating that the content-based approach is working as designed.

3. **Diversification Potential**: While maintaining sector consistency, the system occasionally suggests stocks from sectors that are not dominant in the user's portfolio, which could help with diversification.

## Limitations and Areas for Improvement

1. **Technology Sector Bias**: There appears to be a preference for recommending Technology stocks across different user portfolios. This could be due to:
   - Overrepresentation of Technology stocks in the dataset
   - Technology stocks having more distinctive or homogeneous feature patterns
   - Potential bias in the feature engineering or similarity calculation

2. **Limited Explanation**: The current system provides similarity scores but doesn't explain why specific stocks are recommended beyond sector information.

3. **Unclear Risk Management**: The system doesn't explicitly consider portfolio risk metrics or optimal diversification.

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine content-based with collaborative filtering to address the potential sector bias.

2. **Explainable Recommendations**: Enhance the system to provide specific reasons for each recommendation (e.g., "recommended due to similar profit margin and lower volatility").

3. **Risk-Adjusted Recommendations**: Incorporate risk metrics and portfolio optimization principles to suggest stocks that not only match user preferences but also optimize the risk-return profile.

4. **User Preference Learning**: Add the ability to incorporate explicit user feedback to refine recommendations over time.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Implement formal evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and diversity scores to quantitatively assess recommendation quality.

## Conclusion

The stock recommender system demonstrates effective content-based matching, successfully identifying stocks with similar characteristics to those in a user's portfolio. While it shows a tendency to recommend Technology stocks, this is consistent with the content-based approach, which recommends items similar to what users already have.

For a production system, addressing the identified limitations would create a more balanced, insightful, and personalized recommendation experience.
